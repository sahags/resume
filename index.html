                    Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur)</h4>
                    <p>Sept'21-June'22<br />
                    Mentor: Dr.Nagma Parveen</p>
                    <p>Abstract: To study the virus-receptor interaction in vitro, we used model membranes (liposomes,
                    proteoliposomes, supported lipid bilayer). We started with simple dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
                    (DOPC) lipid then increased its complexity by adding different lipids and cholesterol and finally
                    incorporated the protein into it. We checked different parameters that affect the liposome formation
                    as well as supported lipid bilayer formation. We also proposed the function of Bio-Beads SM-2
                    (nonpolar polystyrene absorbent) in the removal of detergent which eventually led us to construct
                    the proteoliposome. Mimicking membranes- liposomes & proteoliposome could be a useful tool to
                    study the virus-receptor interaction in a cell free environment.</p>
